Rock, paper, scissors is a game played by using hands which can also be used as a toss when a decision on something between two or more people cannot be made. To play this game, participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then put their hands forward forming the shape of either of the three. Making a fist represents rock, an open hand with palm facing down represents paper and two fingers (index and middle finger) extended represents scissors. In this article, we will walk through how to make a rock paper scissor game in Python.
